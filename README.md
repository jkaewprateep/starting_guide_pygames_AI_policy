🧸💬 In some cases of game training we do not have to input all possible action responses to inputs. Still, we can create a  simple policy showing how feedback on the model training is rewarding, the same as reinforcement learning. By simple policy same as we create equation guidelines for machine learning to find solution feedback in the scope with rewards and punishment training feedback method. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ In some cases there are system rules, games rules, and learning methods where games rules and system rules cannot violate to have continuity of the action but to create an equation to respond to more than one goal is difficult to understand by handmaking but it may simple by the machine learning in some case they are main method to find the solution within the scopes we are permitted. </br>
🦭💬 There is no way to form coefficients from our polynomials equation to perform this complex task and vary by its input but simple policy for multiple policies can do it easily by us human merged requirements is one method of the solution from the AI machine learning, merged requirements form today our instruments such as sensors, calibrators, equalizers and even they are using in complex response alarm firewalls or notification system. </br>
🐯💬 Culture-INFO, merged requirements can perform verification by their input as rules bases and test cases this way is similar to the comparison method where there is more than one requirement all are responses to each scenario. </br>
